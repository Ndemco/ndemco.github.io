Hi, I’m Nick. I build backend systems.

My love language is Kotlin. My love interest is Go.

I was born on December 23, 1991. I discovered my passion for software engineering a little later than most—around age 28—thanks to a handful of people whose enthusiasm for the craft was contagious.

I have two kids and a wife who’s far too good for me.

I enjoy a good cigar on a cool, still night.

From software to plumbing, I like building systems—understanding how things work, why they fail, and how to make them better.

I have strong (and changing) opinions about software engineering. This is where I plan to make them known.
